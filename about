Idea behind this project is to use the camera (modules) installed on laptops or even an external camera to control my dimmable lamp

Part list:
     - uController probably something like esp8266 - x1
     - Jumper or either a 22 AWG cable - No idea
     - Raspberry Pi - preferably version 3> and a camera module

TODO:
    - Map hand gestures to some sort of command
    - Create a menu to control the temperature and brightness of the lamp - that utilizes hand gesture motions
