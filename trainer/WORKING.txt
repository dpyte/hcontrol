Idea is to train a model to train a model that can scan for change in hand, frame by frame, and generate an output based on that.

At first, I was thinking on using landmarks to calculate the motion, however, that results in consistent usage of CPU required to perform calculations unless I use an optimized algorithm and proper utilization of CPU cache.
Using an inference engine, in theory, should decrease the system load.
