## HCONTROL
Using hand gestures to control my dimmable lamp


NOTE: I am reworking on this and organizing to integrate support for desktop window control (primarily Windows :\). I created this back when I was still in college and wanted to learn something...

# CHANGES
- 2025-21-10: Removed the old code i.e., C++ code. The transition to pure Python from C++ was necessary as Python-C++ bridge was a performance bottleneck. (PS: I did use LLM to migrate the code)
